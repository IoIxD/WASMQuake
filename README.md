### WASMQuake

This is an attempt ~~that will probably fail~~ for me to make a port of Quake 1 to WASM/WebGL, becoming more comfortable with C and GL in the process.

Since this is a learning project I do not intend on taking outside pull requests or code from too many other repositories, at least not until it's finished.
